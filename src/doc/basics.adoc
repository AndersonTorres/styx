== Basics

Styx is using the Nix expression language.
The Nix expression language is a lazy evaluated functional language with unconventional semantics. +
It is recommended to read the link:http://nixos.org/nix/manual/#ch-expression-language[Nix expression language chapter] of the Nix manual to get more familiar with it.

=== Hello world!

Let's look at a very basic example of a styx site.

[source, nix]
.Hello world!
----
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} # <1>
, styxLib }: # <2>

let # <3>

  lib = import styxLib pkgs; # <4>

  index = { # <5>
    layout = template: "<html><body>${template}</body></html>"; # <6>
    template = p: p.content; # <7>
    content = "<h1>Hello world!</h1>"; # <8>
    href = "index.html"; # <9>
  }; # <10>

in # <11>
  lib.generateSite { pagesList = [ index ]; } # <12>
----

<1> `site.nix` is a function written in the nix language. Nix functions have the `{ arg1 ? default, arg2, ..., argN }: body` pattern.
So this line says that the function take a `pkgs` argument that defaults to `import <nixpkgs> {}`.
<2> The function take a second argument, `styxLib`. This argument must be provided as it has no default. `styxLib` is the styx library and is automatically passed by the `styx` command.
<3> `let` is a special construction to declare local variables, a `let` block must finish by a `in`. `let a = 1; b = 2; in a + b` is a basic example of using `let`.
<4> This declare a `lib` variable that holds the styx library. `import` is used to importing a file. `styxLib` is a function and require `pkgs` as a parameter. +
An easier way to write this would be `(import styxLib) pkgs`, importing the `styxLib` and passing `pkgs` as a parameter.
<5> This declare an `index` variable as an attribute set. An attribute set is a basic key-value structure. `index` will be the only page generated.
<6> To generate a page, styx requires a few attributes to be set, namely `layout`, `template` and `href`. This line declares the `layout` attribute that is a function that take the `template` attribute and return the page source. +
`template:` is different from the first point function head, this function use a simple parameter (Point one was using an attribute set parameter).
<7> This declare a `template` attribute. `template` is a function that takes the page attribute set, `index` in this case as a parameter and generate a result that will be passed to the `layout` function.
<8> This declare a `content` attribute. This is not mandatory, and could have been integrated in the `template` key. But most of styx data fetchers will add a `content` attribute to the page set containing the fetched content.
<9> This declare a `href` attribute. The `href` attribute is used to specify the path of the page to be generated.
<10> Closing the `index` page attribute set.
<11> The `in` mark the end of the `let` declaration, this means `lib` and `index` will be available in the next expression.
<12> This generate the site by using the library `generateSite` function, its parameter is an attribute set with the argument `pagesList` being a list of the single `index` page.

Everything is ready, the "Hello world!" site preview can be generated.

[source, shell]
.Generating a preview of the "Hello world!" site
----
$ styx preview
----

NOTE: `import <nixpkgs> {}` is a way to import the system nixpkgs (nix package manager package set). So by default, a styx site will use the system `nixpkgs`.

TIP: Even if this is a simple example, nix language semantics can be confusing. In a nutshell to build a site, `generateSite` evaluates `page.layout (page.template page)` and output the result in `page.href` for every page in `pagesList`. +
That is the reason `layout`, `template` and `href` are required attributes of a page set.

NOTE: Nix expression language is lazily evaluated, so infinite data structures are not a problem (unless some code try to evaluate them).

=== Structure

In its simplest form, styx just needs a `site.nix` to generate a site like presented in the <<Hello world!>> example. 

But the `styx new` command will generate a few more files for convenience.

[source]
----
├── conf.nix # <1>
├── readme.md # <2>
├── site.nix # <3>
├── data/ # <4>
└── themes/ # <5>
----

<1> `conf.nix` is the main configuration, see <<Configuration>> for details.
<2> `readme.md` provides some basic information about how to start using styx.
<3> `site.nix` is the main file for site generation, see <<sitenix>> for details.
<4> `data/` is an empty directory meant to hold site data.
<5> `themes/` is an empty directory meant to hold site themes.

NOTE: The file structure of styx is totally free and can be changed at will. +
It is even possible to change the name of `site.nix`. In that case the `--file` flag of the styx command can be used to specify the file name.


=== site.nix

The `site.nix` used in the <<Hello world!>> example contains only enough code to generate a single page. It is likely that a `site.nix` to generate a normal site will contain more informations.

The extreme case is the `showcase` theme example site `site.nix` that use every feature available.

It is best practice to divide `site.nix` in multiple sections, with each section handling a particular topic. +
It is common to use the following sections:

- Init
- Themes
- Template environments
- Data
- Pages
- Arguments preparation
- `generateSite`

==== site.nix in a nutshell

====
`site.nix` is a function:

- taking at least the styx library as an argument.
- returning the `generateSite` function.
====

====
`generateSite` is a function:

- taking at least the list of pages set to generate as an argument.
- that evaluate each page set with `page.layout (page.template page)` and output the result in `page.href`.
- returning a generated static site.
====

====
Everything that is between the top function head and `generateSite` is meant to prepare the arguments for `generateSite`.
====

==== Init

This section is the basic setup of styx, it should not be changed and used as is for most setups.

[source, nix]
.Standard Init section
----
/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Init

   Initialization of Styx, should not be edited
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {}
, styxLib
, renderDrafts ? false
, siteUrl ? null
, lastChange ? null
}@args:

let lib = import styxLib pkgs;
in with lib;

let

  /* Configuration loading
  */
  conf = let # <1>
    conf       = import ./conf.nix;
    themesConf = lib.themes.loadConf { inherit themes themesDir; };
    mergedConf = recursiveUpdate themesConf conf;
  in
    overrideConf mergedConf args;

  /* Site state
  */
  state = { inherit lastChange; };

  /* Load themes templates
  */
  templates = lib.themes.loadTemplates {
    inherit themes defaultEnvironment customEnvironments themesDir;
  };

  /* Load themes static files
  */
  files = lib.themes.loadFiles {
    inherit themes themesDir;
  };
----

<1> This loads the `conf.nix` file and merges it with theme configuration and main function `siteUrl` argument.


==== Themes

This section is where used themes are declared. Themes are a central concept in styx and provide ways to manage site assets in a very flexible manner.

Themes are detailed in the <<Themes>> section.

[source, nix]
.Standard themes section
----
/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Themes setup

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

  /* Themes location
  */
  themesDir = ./themes; # <1>

  /* Themes used
  */
  themes = [ "showcase" ]; # <2>
----

<1> `themesDir` should be set relatively to `site.nix`, that is the reason `themesDir` is set it to `../..` in themes example site.
<2> `themes` is a list so it is possible to set multiple themes at the same time. Themes at the beginning of the list have a higher priority.

NOTE: Styx tries to be as explicit as possible. `themes` and `themesDir` are not hardcoded names but just conventions and can be changed if the Init section is updated accordingly.


==== Template environments

Template environments control the set of variables available in the templates.

There are two types of environment:

- Default: The environment used in every template that do not have a custom environment
- Custom: Custom environment for a specific template

Normal sites should not require custom environments, but they can become useful in more complex setups.

[source, nix]
.Standard template environments section
----
/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Template environments

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/


  /* Default template environment
  */
  defaultEnvironment = { inherit conf state lib templates data; }; # <1>

  /* Custom environments for specific templates
  */
  customEnvironments = {}; # <2>
----

<1> This declare the default environment thet should feed most of needs.
<2> Custom template environments are detailed in the template section.

NOTE: `defaultEnvironment` refers to not yet declared variables, but it is not a problem as the let block allows to access any variable declared or that will be declared in it.

==== Data

The data section is responsible for loading data used in the site.

The <<Data>> section explains in detail how to manage data.

[source, nix]
.Standard data section 
----
/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Data

   This section declares the data used by the site
   the data set is included in the default template environment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

  data = {
    about  = loadFile { dir = ./pages; file = "about.md"; }; # <1>
  };
----

<1> Example of loading a markdown file with the `loadFile` function.

==== Pages

The pages section is used to declare the pages generated by `generateSite`. +
Even if `generateSite` expects a page list, it is usually declared as an attribute set for convenience.

There are multiple functions available to generate different type of pages, but a page is ultimately an attribute set with at least the `layout`, `template` and `href` attribute defined.

The <<Pages>> section explains in detail how to create pages.

[source, nix]
.Standard pages section
----
/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Pages

   This section declares the pages that will be generated
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

  pages = {

    about = {
      href = "about.html";
      template = templates.generic.full;
    } // data.about; # <1>

  };
----

<1> `//` is the operator to merge attribute sets, this merge the `data.about` set attributes in the `pages.about` attribute set.

NOTE: As many pages tends to use the same layout, the `layout` attribute is usually set in one go to all templates in the "arguments preparation" section. +
Only pages that use a different layout explicitly set it in `pages`.

==== Argument preparation

This is the last part before generating the site. The only purpose of this section is to prepare the `generateSite` function arguments.

[source, nix]
.Standard argument preparation section
----
/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   generateSite arguments preparation

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

  pagesList = let
    # converting pages attribute set to a list
    list = pagesToList pages;
    # setting a default layout
    in map (setDefaultLayout templates.layout) list;

  substitutions = {
    siteUrl = conf.siteUrl;
  };
----

This section just turns the `pages` attribute set into a list of pages, and set a default `layout` to pages that did not declare one.

The substitution set should be declared in this section.

NOTE: For details about substitutions see <<Substitutions>>.

==== generateSite

This is the final part and shortest section of `site.nix`. This section consists in a call to <<lib.generation.generateSite,`generateSite`>>.

[source, nix]
.Standard generateSite section
----
/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Site rendering

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

in generateSite { inherit files pagesList substitutions; }
----

NOTE: `files` is automatically generated in the init section with the enabled themes.

NOTE: `inherit` is a shorthand for writing sets, `{ inherit a; }` is equivalent to `{ a = a; }`.


=== Configuration

Styx is configured with the `conf.nix` file present in the site root directory.

This files consists in an attribute set defining configuration options, and custom attributes can be added at will.

The main configuration is made through themes via the `theme` attribute. Every theme defines some set of configuration that can be override in `conf.nix` `theme` attribute.

`siteUrl` is the only required field, and must not end with a slash.

[source, nix]
.Standard conf.nix
----
{
  # URL of the site, must be set to the url of the domain the site will be deployed
  siteUrl = "http://yourdomain.com";

  # Theme specific settings
  # it is possible to override any of the theme configuration settings in the 'theme' set
  theme = {
    # Changing the theme site.title setting
    site.title = "Styx Site";
  };
}
----
