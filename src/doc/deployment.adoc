== Deployment

=== GitHub pages

Styx support basic deployment to GitHub pages.

This is a two step process:

- first by preparing the repository to deploy on GitHub pages. (`deploy --init-gh-pages`)
- then by updating that branch. (`deploy --gh-pages`)

==== Initialization

`styx deploy --init-gh-pages` command will prepare the repository for GitHub deployment. This command will do the following:

- create a `gh-pages` directory
- add the `gh-pages` folder to `.gitignore`
- clone the repository in the `gh-pages` folder
- create a new empty `gh-pages` branch in the `gh-pages` folder


==== Update the gh-pages branch

`styx deploy --gh-pages` command will build the site, and update the `gh-pages` folder folder with the generated static site and commit it to the `gh-pages` branch.


=== Other

Styx does not yet provide a universal deployment method, but `rsync` can be used to deploy a Styx site to a remote server via ssh.
