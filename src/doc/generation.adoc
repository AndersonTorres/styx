== Site Generation

Site generation is the final section of `site.nix`.

It mainly consists in a call to `generateSite`, and the preparation of its arguments.

=== Hooks

`generateSite` provide two hooks to customize the site generation process:

- `preGen`: A string or multiline string with shell commands to run before generating the site.
- `postGen`: A string or multiline string with shell commands to run after generating the site.
