== Installation

The only requirement to install Styx is the link:http://nixos.org/nix/[Nix package manager].
Refer to the link:http://nixos.org/nix/manual/#chap-installation[Nix installation instructions] to install Nix.

Styx does not have an official release yet, but it is possible to install a development snapshot with the following command:

[source, bash]
----
$ nix-env -i https://github.com/ericsagnes/styx/archive/master.tar.gz
----

To only test Styx, it is recommended to use the `nix-shell` command to start a temporary environment including Styx:

[source, bash]
----
$ nix-shell -p `nix-build https://github.com/ericsagnes/styx/archive/master.tar.gz`
----
