== Quick Start

The Styx showcase site can be created and locally served with the following set of commands:

[source, bash]
----
$ styx new styx-showcase # <1>
$ cd styx-showcase # <2>
$ git clone https://github.com/styx-static/styx-theme-showcase.git themes/showcase # <3>
$ styx preview --in themes/showcase/example # <4>
----

<1> Initialize a new styx site in the `styx-showcase` directory.
<2> Enter the `styx-showcase` directory.
<3> Download the `styx-showcase` theme in the `themes` directory.
<4> Launch a local server to preview the showcase theme example site.

The `styx-showcase` example site will be accessible at link:http://127.0.0.1:8080[http://127.0.0.1:8080]. Check the posts as they provide some information about how styx works.

The `styx-showcase` main file, `site.nix` is quite complex as most of the styx features are used in it. It is recommended to start by reading the <<sitenix,site.nix>> section to get familiar on how `site.nix` is structured.
