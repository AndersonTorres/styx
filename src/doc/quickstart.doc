== Quick Start

A Styx site can be created and locally served with the following set of commands:

[source, bash]
----
$ nix-shell -p $(nix-build https://github.com/styx-static/styx/archive/latest.tar.gz) # <1>
[nix-shell]$ styx new myblog # <2>
[nix-shell]$ cd myblog # <3>
[nix-shell:~/myblog]$ styx preview # <4>
----

<1> Enter a nix-shell with Styx.
<2> Generate a new site in the `myblog` directory.
<3> Enter the Styx site root folder.
<4> Start a preview the site on a local server.

Your styx site will be available at link:http://127.0.0.1:8080[http://127.0.0.1:8080].

Now, take a look at the `site.nix` to see how the site is defined. There are many comments, but in doubt check the <<sitenix,site.nix>> section, it explains `site.nix` in details.
