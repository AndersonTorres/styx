== Themes

Themes are a central concept in styx and are used to manage a site assets, namely files and templates.
They also provide a configuration interface.

Themes also can be combined to offer modularity and easiness of upgrade.

=== Getting themes

Styx themes are all listed in the official link:https://github.com/styx-static/themes[theme repository].

Themes available at the moment of writing this documentation are:

- link:https://github.com/styx-static/styx-theme-showcase[Showcase]: A theme that show most of styx functionalities and provides many templates.
- link:https://github.com/styx-static/styx-theme-hyde[Hyde]: A port of the link:https://github.com/poole/hyde[Jekyll Hyde theme] to styx. Hyde is a simple and beautiful blog theme.
- link:https://github.com/styx-static/styx-theme-agency[Agency]: A port of the link:http://themes.gohugo.io/agency/[Hugo agency theme] to styx. Agency is a single page site with a modern design fitting company or agency websites.
- link:https://github.com/styx-static/styx-theme-orbit[Orbit]: A port of the link:http://themes.gohugo.io/orbit/[Hugo orbit theme] to styx. Orbit is a single page site resume / profile theme.

Themes should be installed in the `themes` directory. Using `git` is the recommended way.

[source, shell]
.Installing the showcase theme via git
----
$ git clone https://github.com/styx-static/styx-theme-showcase.git themes/showcase
----


[source, shell]
.Installing all themes
----
$ git clone --depth 1 --recursive https://github.com/styx-static/themes.git themes
----

=== Structure

Themes are usually stored in the `themes` directory, but this can be changed in `site.nix`.

Every theme is stored in its own directory, and themes are expected to follow a certain structure.

[source, shell]
.Anatomy of a Styx theme
-----
themes
└── NAME # <1>
    ├── theme.nix # <2>
    ├── files # <3>
    └── templates # <4>
-----

<1> Name of the theme. The name should be a valid directory name.
<2> `theme.nix` defines the theme configuration options, this is file is required and must be named `theme.nix`.
<3> `files` is a directory holding static files for the themes. All the files in this directory will be copied in the generated site.
<4> `templates` is a directory storing all the templates files.

NOTE: Themes structure is one of the few part using implicit settings in styx.

=== theme.nix

`theme.nix` defines the theme configuration interface. It is defined as an attribute set.

It is a simple attribute set that defines the theme configuration options with some default values.

[source, nix]
.Example of a theme.nix
----
{
  site = {
    title = "The Agency";
    author = "Your name";
    description = "Your description";
  };
}
----

====
`theme.nix` attribute set will be merged in `site.nix` `conf` variable in two attributes:

- `conf.theme`: The global theme configuration, all the enabled themes configuration will be merged in this variable. This allow to extend theme configuration in `conf.nix`.
Templates that access themes configuration should use `conf.theme`.
- `conf.themes.NAME`: `NAME` is the theme name, this holds the theme default configuration as it is declared in `theme.nix`.
====

=== Files

The `files` directory holds the static files of the theme. Every file in in this directory will be copied in the generated site.

NOTE: If multiple themes are enabled, every theme `file` directory contents will be copied to the generated site.

==== Special files

Styx automatically convert `sass`, `scss` and `less` files to css during site generation.


=== Templates

Every template in the `templates` will be accessible by its file basename in the `templates` attribute set.
Directories are converted to nested sets.

[source, shell]
.Example of a template directory structure
-----
├── archive.nix
└── post
    ├── full.nix
    └── list.nix
-----

[source, nix]
.Generated attribute set
-----
templates = {
  archive = <<lambda>>;
  posts = {
    full = <<lambda>>;
    list = <<lambda>>;
  };
};
-----

NOTE: the `\<<lambda>>` notation is borrowed from the `nix-repl` tool, and means a non fully evaluated function. +
The nix language is functional, and it allows to partially apply functions and to pass function as argument to other functions.

'''

Styx templates are functions that return text or page attribute sets when fully evaluated.

Templates are divided in three types:

- Layout templates, responsible for the final rendering of a page, it must return text. (page attribute set `layout` key)
- Normal templates, responsible for preparing a page for the layout template, this kind of templates usually return a page attribute set.
- Partial templates, responsible for rendering a part of a layout or a normal template. 

The normal template evaluation flow is:

- The normal template evaluate the page attribute set and generates a partial result that is stored in the page attribute set `content` key.
- The layout template evaluate the page attribute set returned by the partial template and produce the final source of the page.

==== Text handling basics

Most of the work in template is done by manipulating text.

This introduce the basics of text handling in the templates:

- single-line or multi-line text (leading spaces are stripped without changing relative line align), delimited by `''`.

+
[source, nix]
.Multi-line text
----
''
  Hello world!
  Hello Styx!
''
----

- single-line or multi-line text, delimited by `"`.

+
[source, nix]
.Single-line text
----
"Hello world!"
----

Nix expressions can be included in text in enclosed in `${...}`.

[source, nix]
.Expression antiquotation
----
let name = "world"; in
"Hello ${name}!"
----

==== Layout templates

The layout template is responsible for rendering the final source of the page. +
The layout template function usually takes a template environment, and a page attribute set with a `content` attribute.

In a HTML context, the layout template is usually responsible of the HTML code that is not directly related to the content, like the `head` tag contents.

[source, nix]
.Layout template example
----
env:
page:
''
  <html>
    ...
  <body>
    ...
    ${page.content}
    ...
  </body>
  </html>
''
----

TIP: Layout templates are just functions, in case the partial template return the full page source like in a rss feed case, it is possible to set the page `layout` to the `id` function. This will make the layout evaluation transparent and return the `template` result.


==== Normal templates

Normal templates are similar to the layout templates, with the only difference that their result will be evaluated by the layout template.
A normal template should set or update the `content` attribute of a page attribute set so the layout template can produce the final source.

Normal templates can also add other attributes to the page attribute to fit any special need.

[source, nix]
.Example of a partial template
----
{ templates, ... }:
page:
let
  content =
    ''
      <h1>${page.title}</h1>
    '';
in
  page // { inherit content; }
----

NOTE: In some cases, it is useful to have the partial template to return the final source of the page. +
By setting the page `layout` to the `id` function, it is possible to bypass the layout template and have the partial template result being the final source source of the page.

==== Partial templates

Partials templates are template that that are used in normal or layout templates.

Partial templates can take arguments and be used to with `mapTemplate` to apply a template to a list of content, or just used as includes.

==== Template environment

The template environment is the first parameter to every template function.

It is automatically set when the templates are loaded from a theme.

The default template environment consists in:

- `conf`: The configuration attribute set.
- `lib`: The library attribute set, it contains Styx and nixpkgs functions.
- `state`: The state attribute set, by default it only holds the timestamp of the generation.
- `templates`: The templates attribute set.
- `data`: The data attribute set.
- `pages`: The pages attribute set.

NOTE: The template environment is set in `site.nix` and can be easily changed.

It is possible to set a specific template environment to a specific template by declaring it in the `customTemplateEnvironments` set.

[source, nix]
.Setting custom template environments
----
  customEnvironments = {
    layout = defaultEnvironment // { foo = "bar"; }; # <1>
  };
----

<1> The environment passed to the `layout` template is the default environment extended with a `foo` variable.


==== Template environment in templates

There are two ways of writing the `environment` in the template, as a set or as a deconstructed set.

[source, nix]
.Environment as a variable
----
environment: # <1>
page:
''
  ${environment.conf.siteTitle}
''
----

<1> `environment` is used as a set, and its key can be accessed with `.`.

[source, nix]
.Environment as a deconstructed set
----
{ conf, lib, ... }: # <1>
page: # <1>
''
  ${conf.siteTitle}
''
----

<1> environment is deconstructed in its keys values. The last `...` means all others keys and is required if the set contains more keys than the keys deconstructed.


==== Calling templates in templates

It is possible to call templates in a template by accessing to the `templates` attribute of the template environment.

[source, nix]
.Calling a template in a template
----
{ templates, ... }:
page:
''
  ${templates.foo}
''
----

NOTE: When templates are loaded, they will automatically receive the template environment as a parameter, this will partially evaluate the template function. This means that the template function will be become a single argument function (`page`).

WARNING: Trying to call the current template will trigger an infinite loop and make the site generation fail.

==== Applying templates to multiple contents

The `mapTemplate` function can be used to map a template to a list of contents.

[source, nix]
.Applying a template to multiple contents
----
{ templates, ... }:
page:
''
  ${mapTemplate templates.post.list page.posts}
''
----


=== Themes in site.nix

Themes are declared as a list in the `themes` variable.

[source, shell]
.Declaring used themes
-----
  themes = [ "default" ]; # <1>
-----

<1> The `themes` variable is a list of theme names, it is possible to set multiple themes. In that cases, themes at the head of the list have a higher priority.

Themes related files are automatically loaded in `site.nix` via the `lib.themes.loadTemplates` and `lib.themes.loadFiles` functions.

[source, shell]
.Loading theme related files
----
  templates = lib.themes.loadTemplates { # <1>
    inherit themes defaultEnvironment customEnvironments;
    themesDir = conf.themesDir;
  };

  files = lib.themes.loadFiles { # <2>
    inherit themes;
    themesDir = conf.themesDir;
  };

  themes = [ "default" ];
----

<1> Load themes templates. See <<themes.loadFiles,loadFiles>> for details.
<2> Load themes files. See <<themes.loadTemplates,loadTemplates>> for details.


=== Combining Themes

In `site.nix`, themes are declared as a list. If multiple themes in the list provide the same file or template, the one from the first theme to declare it will be used.

This allows to "extends" themes without modifying them.

For example, to use the showcase theme but only change the `layout` template. It is possible to create a new theme, and copy the `layout.nix` template in the new theme `templates` directory and change only this file.

[source, bash]
.Creating a new foo theme
----
$ styx new theme --in themes # <1>
$ cp themes/{showcase,foo}/templates/layout.nix # <2>
----

<1> Create the theme directory.
<2> Copying `showcase` theme `layout.nix` to `foo` theme.

After a new theme has been created, it must be declared in `site.nix` to be used.

[source, nix]
.Using foo and default themes in `site.nix`
----
  themes = [ "foo" "showcase" ]; #<1>
----

<1> Using foo and showcase theme, with foo having a higher priority than default.

TIP: Combining themes is the recommended way to extend an existing theme as it make theme upgrades easier.
