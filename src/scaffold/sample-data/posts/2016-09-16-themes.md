This post introduce the main way to create and customize styx sites, themes.

>>>

Themes in styx are more than just a way to change the visuals of a site.

A theme can provide the following:

- Template files
- Static files
- A configuration interface
- An example site
- A function library


## Basics

Themes used are declared in `site.nix`, local themes can be used by proving a path, and themes member of the `styx-themes` package can be used by providing the package name.

To use a themes, it is just required to add it to the `themes` list:

```
  themes = [
    styx-themes.generic-templates
    ./themes/my-theme
  ];
```

In this example, the `styx-themes.generic-templates` is combined with the `./themes/my-theme` theme.


## Previewing a theme example site

Previewing a theme from the `styx-themes` package set is easily done with the following command:

```
$ styx preview --in $(nix-build --no-out-link -A styx-themes.showcase '<nixpkgs>')/example
```

The list of themes in the `styx-themes` set can be listed with the following command:

```
$ nix-env -f "<nixpkgs>" -qaP -A styx-themes
styx-themes.agency    styx-theme-agency-2016-12-03
styx-themes.hyde      styx-theme-hyde-2016-12-03
styx-themes.orbit     styx-theme-orbit-2016-12-03
styx-themes.showcase  styx-theme-showcase-2016-12-04
```

## Configuration interface

A theme can provide many configuration options that can be used to customize it.  
These configuration options can be used and changed in the site `conf.nix`. An interesting feature is that these options can be typed, and if they are styx will automatically do a type check when building a site.

The configuration interface can also be used to generate documentation.
